# Coffee Request Frontend
As part of the Bounty Boards hackathon at Laax in Switzerland I quickly built a frontend to grab a cup of coffee from the hacked ethereum-enabled coffee machine in order to pay for it with tokens.
It sends out an approval event for the specified token over a specified amount, which will be picked up and transfered by the coffee machine.
